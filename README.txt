SNR
===

SNR provides a soft-realtime-robotics framework for education. It was 
originally developed for the Cal POly Robotics Club Underwater
Remote Operated Vehicle (UROV). Typical usage often looks like this::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from snr import *

    # TODO: Sample code

(Note the double-colon and 4-space indent formatting above.)

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
and ``monospace`` look like this.


A Section
=========

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

A Sub-Section
-------------

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. hi there

2. must be going

Urls are http://like.this and links can be
written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.
