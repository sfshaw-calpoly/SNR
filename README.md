SNR provides a soft-realtime robotics framework for education. It was originally developed for the Cal Poly Robotics Club Underwater Remote Operated Vehicle (UROV). SNR aims to provide a platform for teaching robotics, systems design, and embedded programming. SNR provides paradigms similar to [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and NASA's [FÂ´](https://github.com/nasa/fprime) but in a simpler stack.

## Get Started
Install SNR from source

    git clone https://github.com/sfshaw-calpoly/SNR
    cd SNR
    python3 -m pip install . --user --upgrade

Typical usage for the CPRC UROV might have a `main.py` like this:

    from snr import *
    
    def main():
        sockets_pair = SocketsPair(...)
        config = Config(Mode.DEPLOYED, {
            'topside': [
                XBoxControllerFactory(),
                InputProcessorFactory(),
                sockets_pair.server_factory,
                ],
            'urov': [
                sockets_pair.client_factory,
                ControlsProcessorFactory(),
                MotorControllerFactory(),
                SerialConnectionFactory(),
                SensorsProcessorFactory(),
                ],
        })
        runner = CLIRunner(config)
        runner.run()


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
        
To run the node on the topside control unit:
    
    python3 main.py topside   

To run the node on the UROV itself:

    python3 main.py urov
    
## Paradigms
- User code resides in Endpoints and Loops, encouraging discrete modules of functionality
- Endpoints provide synchronous task handlers to the Node's event loop
- Loops run in their own loop context, separate from the Node's event loop
- Each node has a role, a set of Endpoints and Loops, and a Datastore
- Endpints and Loops can read and write key-value pairs (Pages) to their parent node's Datastore
- Endpoints and Loops can schedule events (Tasks) for their parent node's event loop (TaskQueue)
- Nodes are wrapped in Runners, which construct them based on a Config
- Configs contain a map of roles to component Factories
- Factories construct Endpoints and Loops, enabling hot-reloading
